# coinbase-pro-api-rust: A simple wrapper for the Coinbase API
 
This crate, in tandem with the cbpro-automated-trading-framework crate, allows users to create simple trading strategies based on data from Coinbase Pro. In particular, this data consists of price updates, bids, asks, volume updates, and trade timesâ€”essentially, this is all the data that an order book consists of. Users can develop any function based on this data to indicate when they want trades to occur, and coinbase-pro-api-rust will do all the hard work of interacting with Coinbase Pro behind the scenes, collecting data, and sending requests.

# How it Works 

coinbase-pro-api-rust and cbpro-automated-trading-framework use both the Coinbase Pro HTTP REST API and Websocket API. The Websocket API is used to collect real-time data and the REST API is used to place orders and get account information if necessary. Neither of these are directly interacted with by a user, however. A user who would like to create a strategy simply needs to write a function based on the TradingData struct (containing order book data) and pass it into a Strategy struct. This Strategy struct will then listen for data on a Websocket and execute trades based on the strategy.

A strategy could be as simple as selling when a price goes above a certain number and buying when a price drops below a certain number:

~~~ 
fn strat (user: &AuthorizedClient, data: &TradingData) {
  if data.products["BTC-USD"].price > Decimal::new(30000, 0) {
    user.place_order(sell ... ); // sell BTC 
  } else if data.products["BTC-USD"].price < Decimal::new(20000, 0) {
    user.place_order(buy ... );
  }
}
~~~
Note that any indicators based on TradingData can be used to develop a strategy. 
Then, this "strategy function" is passed into a new Strategy struct, which has a name and authorized user associated with it:

~~~
let mut my_strategy = Strategy::new("Example Name", user, vec!["BTC-USD"], strat);
my_strategy.subscribe_to_ticker_data(); // start collecting data
my_strategy.run(); // initiate strategy based on function!
~~~

That's it! Easy, right? Happy coding!
